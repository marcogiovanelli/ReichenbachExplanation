%As Reichenbach once put it, after Einstein, even if there were absolute time, it would not be absolute \citep[18/110]{Reichenbach1922}.

%However, an entry in Rudolf Carnap’s diary recording a meeting with Reichenbach near Berlin on \datef{2}{9}{1926} indicates that Reichenbach continued to stress the importance of the distinction between the two types of contraction: \qt{He explained me the difference between Lorentz and Einstein contractions}{Er erkl\"art mir den Unterschied zwischen Lorentz- und Einstein-Verk\"{u}rzung} \citep[303]{Carnap2022}. 


%Let $K$ be a stationary frame with synchronized clocks. A bar $AB$ moves along the $x$-axis of $K$. Imagine a device that marks two points, $A'$ and $B'$, on the $x$-axis, when $A$ and $B$ coincide with them on the $x$-axis at the same time in $K$. $A'B'$ is what Reichenbach calls the \emph{projection} of $AB$ in $K$

%Einstein contraction compares the same rod \emph{with respect to different reference frames within the same theory}. Lorentz contraction, by contrast, compares the same rod \emph{in the same frame with respect to different theories} using the light-geometrical definition of length as \emph{tertium comparationis} \rzl{228}{196f.}.  

 %A magnetic needle has no intrinsic orientation; however, the fact that it always points north means that it \s{adjusts} every time to the Earth's magnetic field. Similar rods have no intrinsic length; they \s{adjust} themselves to light geometry \citep[66]{Reichenbach1927}.

%The weakness of the dynamical approach is ultimately encapsulated in the separation between the light and matter axioms at the core of Reichenbach's axiomatization. %Einstein did not restate this coincidence in the form of a \emph{convention}, as Reichenbach argues. Instead, he elevated it to a \emph{constraint} on all possible theories of matter and radiation. For this reason,



%In his reading, Einstein simply transformed this coincidence into a \textit{convention}, while \Mink only provided a geometrical \textit{interpretation} of such conventional choice. Reichenbach found this \s{trick} unsatisfying. He concluded, like modern dynamicists, that some \emph{detailed} theory of matter describing the behavior of \rac is required to explain the failure of \ED experiments. 



%What explains the failure of all \ED experiments is that \emph{all} laws of nature are Lorentz invariant, not a the \emph{particular} laws of matter that happen to hold are Lorentz invariant.

% The behavior of radiation always agreed to that of matter, since they are both Lorentz invariant.

%From this perspective the fact that the available theory of radiation and the theory of matter both happen to be Lorentz invariant is a \textit{coincidence}. Einstein transforms this coincidence into a \textit{constraint} that all theories of matter and radiation must satisfy. 

%The explanation of the negative result of \ED experiments is not that a \textit{particular} Lorentz invariant theory of matter holds, as Reichenbach argues, but the requirement \textit{all} possible theory of matter are Lorentz invariant.  

%The comparison with \th illuminates the difference. If a \pemo machine could be constructed using a certain physical process, it would not simply mean that the particular laws of nature governing the process violate energy conservation—it would mean that the principle of energy conservation must be abandoned.


%Thus, Einstein appears to reject both the dynamical and geometrical explanations. 

%Thus, Einstein appears to reject both the dynamical and geometrical explanations. If one wishes to cast Einstein's approach in explanatory terms, it is more appropriate, following the suggestion of Marc \citet{Lange2016}, to refer to it as an \emph{explanation by constraint}. Indeed, in this suggestion best captures the meaning of Einstein's comparison with \th. Both \th and \rt transform what appears to be a mere \emph{coincidence}—the repeated negative result of an experiment—into a \emph{constraint}. \Th claims that, if the construction of a \pemo is to be impossible, then \emph{all} laws of nature \emph{must} satisfy the requirement of energy conservation. \Sr claims that, if the construction of an ether-wind detecting device is to be impossible, \emph{all} laws of nature \emph{must} satisfy the requirement of Lorentz invariance. The words \emph{all} and \emph{must} are key to the explanatory role in both theories. This, I think, is what the dynamical approach misunderstands. 

%\s{What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.}

%For the dynamical approach, like in Lorentz theory, the failure of \ED experiments experiment is explained by the \emph{coincidence} that the \emph{specific} theories of radiations and matter that hold in nature \emph{happen to} be Lorentz invariant. On the contrary, in Einstein's theory, the failure of \ED experiments is explained by the \emph{requirement} that \emph{any} physical theories  of matter and radiation \emph{must} be Lorentz invariant. 


%Reichenbach encoded this misunderstanding in his own axiomatic system by separating the light and matter axioms and declaring their agreement a coincidence. In Reichenbach's assessment, Einstein simply transformed this coincidence into a convention, forgoing any explanation in terms of a particular matter theory. However, Einstein's move was different: he transformed the coincidence into a constraint that all matter theories must satisfy. 



%The word \s{contraction} is, however, a misnomer; what we should explain is not the effect of motion through the ether on the rod, but why the rod is shorter than it would have been in the old theory of the round-trip time of light is used as a standard of length;\todo{improve}


%The main point of Reichenbach's axiomatization of special relativity is the \emph{separation} between the light axioms and the matter axioms. While the distinction between classical and relativistic light geometry is the result of a \emph{convention}, the agreement between matter geometry and relativistic light geometry is a fact that requires \emph{explanation}: actual rods behave relativistically like $l$ and not classically like $L$. \begin{inparaenum}[(a)] \item Lorentz offered a \emph{poor dynamical explanation} of this fact, since it considers the behavior $L$ as normal and seeks to explain the deviation. \item Einstein rejected that prejudice and declared the behavior $l$ as the natural one, claiming that \emph{no dynamical explanation} was necessary. \item \Mink provided a graphical representation of, but \emph{no geometrical explanation}. \end{inparaenum} Reichenbach concluded that \sr is still explanatory deficient. Why do rods behave precisely like $l$, and not classically like $L$? A \emph{good dynamical explanation} is necessary to explain why material rods of all kinds happen to adjust to precisely to the behavior of electromagnetic radiation.


 %Einstein simply declared that the moving rod retains its length in its own frame, despite appearing shorter when measured in the stationary frame. Einstein achieved this result by introducing \emph{by convention} a new definition of length as a frame-dependent quantity: 


%Reichenbach concluded his reconstruction by arguing against not better specified objections he had received since the publication of his \citeyear{Reichenbach1925} article discussed above (\cref{twocontractions}). In particular, it was argued that it is impossible to compare two magnitudes belonging to \emph{different} theories. However, Reichenbach has no difficulty to retort that we actually do this all the time. We may say, for instance, that a highly compressed gas behaves differently than \emph{it would have} according to Mariotte's law for ideal gases—that is, an ideal gas occupies a smaller volume than a real gas would have occupied in the same conditions \rzl{**}{**}. The comparison is possible because the Euclidean rigid rods used to measure the gas volume serve as a \emph{tertium comparationis} \rzl{**}{**}. Also in special relativity, Reichenbach pointed out, we have a \emph{tertium comparationis}: light-geometrical definitions supply a standard to which the rods of the different theories can be compared \rzl{**}{**}. The difference between the classical theory and the Lorentz-Einstein theory is then an objective fact. 

%The problem is to grasp the difference between Lorentz and Einstein theories:
%
%\begin{enumerate}[label=(a)]
%\item  \cop{the rest-length $l$ of the moving rod is shorter than that of a rod moving according to the classical theory $L$} (Lorentz–Einstein)  
%\item \cop{the length of the moving rod $l$ is shorter than that the rest-length of the rod rest $L$} (Lorentz)\todo{check}.
%\item the rest-length of the moving rod $l$ is equal to the rest-length of the rod at rest $l$ (Einstein)
%\end{enumerate}
%%
%Statement (a) is correct for both theories, thus Lorentz contraction is not \emph{ad hoc}. From (a), Lorentz infers (b), that the moving rod behavior is a distortion of the true rest length. Einstein redefines the concept of length and declares (c), that is that (a) is the default behavior of rigid rods. This move is important, since it removes Lorentz’s crypto-Kantian prejudice that classical behavior must be \apr true in some sense. Einstein could wash his hands and declared a dynamical explanation of the contraction unnecessary. However, Reichenbach felt that this trick was ultimately unsatisfactory. 

%According to Reichenbach, it is correct to claim that Einstein contraction \emph{does not} require any explanation. This contraction is introduced precisely to redefine relativistic rods as rigid. Lorentz contraction, however, \emph{does} call for an explanation. The negative result of the Michelson experiment implies that rods of all materials \emph{happen to} behave in agreement with distances measured by round-trip light signals. How can such a \emph{coincidence} be explained? \Mink's supposed \emph{geometrical explanation}, in Reichenbach's view, is no explanation at all—it is merely a graphical representation of Einstein's move. Lorentz's \emph{dynamical explanation} is unsatisfying, as it assumes classical rod behavior as natural. Reichenbach concluded that the solution lies in a proper analysis of what counts as a \emph{dynamical explanation}.


%$OQ$ is the time axis and represents a clock at rest, while the horizontal axis $OS$ represents a rod at rest in $K$. The right hyperbola represents the locus of points from which a light round-trip yields the same spatial separation; the upper hyperbola represents the locus of points from which a light round-trip takes the same total time on the origin clock. Einstein's relativity of simultaneity is shown diagrammatically by the fact that both the time and space axes can be rotated. The rotation of $OQ$ represents a clock in motion with respect to $K$, while the rotation of $OS$ represents a rod in motion with respect to $K$. The agreement between light geometry and matter geometry is symbolized by the fact that $Q$ and $S$ follow the contours of the hyperbolas.


%The control of natural phenomena is achieved by means of mathematical concepts. These concepts arc defined by implicit definitions and are not dependent on a unique and specific kind of visualization.

%\subsection{Dynamical vs.\  Geometrical Explanation Special Relativity}


%Einstein had shown that determining the simultaneity of distant events requires knowing the speed of light, but measuring the speed of light presupposes knowledge of simultaneity. This circularity implies that simultaneity of distant events cannot be known in principle. 


%
%Unlike Schlick, however, Reichenbach explicitly rejects the idea that a confirmation of Miller's result would entail a revival of the ether theory. 
%s
%If the aether-drift experiments yielded a positive outcome only the material axiom \rom{8} would be challenged—namely, the fact that rods behave according to the relativistic light geometry. The distinction between classical and relativistic light geometries would continue to depend on the conventional definition of simultaneity. Only the claim that rods behave in accordance with the relativistic light geometry would be refuted. 
%
%The choice between them is thus one of simplicity, not truth \citep{Schlick1915}. 


%Einstein was firmly convinced that Miller’s findings were likely flawed, and he even declared himself willing to stake money on that judgment, as he plainly put it \citep{Einstein1926a}. Yet he also made it clear that if Miller’s results were validated, the principle of relativity would have to be entirely relinquished \citep{Hentschel1992a}.

%As we have seen, Reichenbach did not consider Lorentz contraction to be \latin{ad hoc}. Indeed, both Lorentz's and Einstein's theories assert the agreement between matter geometry and relativistic light geometry. 

%Evidence is provided to justify
%claims that something is the case. Explanations are provided to answer
%questions why something is the case.


%As we have seen, for Reichenbach, Lorentz contraction is not \latin{ad hoc} at all, since both Lorentz and Einstein theory presuppose Lorentz contraction, that is the agreement between relativistic light and matter geometry. The key novelty of the theory was the introduction of Einstein contraction, which, however, has nothing to to with such agreement, it serves only as to Einstein could Lorentz and nevertheless consider rods as rigid thus avoiding getting bogged down in the shallows of Lorentz's dynamic explanations of the contraction. Schlick was indeed, right that the difference between their approaches emerge with particular clarity from Reichenbach's reaction to Miller's experiment. If the experiment were to be confirmed, Schlick argued, the universal conspiracy of nature that hide the aether from detection would be broken and we had to return to the ether theory, that is the Lorentz's theory without the contraction hypothesis. On the contrary, according to Reichenbach, no such return was required. In this sense, Schlick argued, Reichenbach's axiomatic method has no \s{physical consequences}:

%Which among the Riemannian geometry happens to hold in reality  is on the contrary a matter of \emph{convention}.

%Einstein (a) defines simultaneity by synchronizing clocks using the assumption of equal round-trip light speed; (b) defines the length of a moving object as the distance between its endpoints measured simultaneously in a given frame; (c) thus, it is not surprising that equal distances correspond to equal round-trip travel times of light in within each inertial frame. 

%In Reichenbach's perspective the light axioms have a higher degrees of certainty since they contain only statements that are already accepted by classical optics, plus the definition of simultaneity. On the contrary, the matter axioms make \emph{new} statements about very complicated material structures, and are only partially verified. Einstein was right in challenging Lorentz's implicit view that the classical light geometry is the natural one, thus declared relativistic rods as rigid. However, one still needs an explanation about why rigid rods do happen to behave according to a relativistic light geometry and not with another one.

%\section{Two Kinds of Contractions: Einstein Contraction vs.\  Lorentz Contraction} 





%Classical aether theory could account for it by postulating that the aether is dragged along with the Earth in its orbit. However, this stratagem contradicts the phenomenon of stellar aberration \crw{**}{**}. If instead one preserves the existence of a stationary aether, with respect to which light travels at a fixed speed $c$, it becomes puzzling how the equality of the travel times is maintained, despite the fact that the apparatus is moving through the ether. As a result, 19th-century optics found itself in a seemingly irresolvable dilemma. The subsequent unfolding, Reichenbach argues, was usually considered uncontroversial.

%How can this negative result be explained? At the turn of the century, \q{Lorentz [\citeyear{Lorentz1895}] in Leyden presented his \myemph{explanation}} of this equality \qt{that assumed that all rigid bodies moving in opposition to the ether undergo a contraction}{H. A. Lorentz in Leyden eine Erkl\"arung gab, die eine Verk\"{u}rzung aller starren K\"orper bei Bewegung gegen den Aether annahm} \crw{325}{197\me}. When moving uniformly through the ether with velocity $v$ relative to the ether frame $K$ (where light travels rectilinearly at speed $c$), the arm $\mathrm{OS}_2$ contracts in the direction of motion by a factor \kappafactor—like a metal bar exposed to cold—compensating for the slower light speed and explaining the experiment's null result. 


%In \citeyear{Einstein1905}, Reichenbach continued, \qt{a more basic explanation was proposed by A.~Einstein in which these contractions occur as a result of a universal principle, the principle of relativity}{Noch tiefer ging die 1905 von A. Einstein aufgestellte Relativit\"atstheorie, welche diese Verk\"{u}rzung als Ausfluß eines universellen Prinzips betrachtet, des Relativit\"atsprinzips;} \crw{326}{197}. Instead of introducing a \emph{deformable} rod, Einstein proposed a new definition of what counts as a \emph{rigid} rod: spatial measurements depend on temporal simultaneity, which in turn is frame-dependent. From this perspective, the horizontal arm $OS_2$ of the Michelson interferometer is \emph{not} shortened with respect to the coordinate system $K'$ co-moving with the Earth; however, it is shortened by a factor \kappafactor with respect to a coordinate system $K$ at rest relative to the Sun. 
%
%Reichenbach concurs with the standard semi-historical account on one point: Lorentz's and Einstein's theories \emph{agree} on the same empirical fact, stated in axiom \rom{8} of his axiom system: \s{Two space intervals which are equal when measured by rigid rods, are also light-geometrically equal}, meaning they are equal when measured by the round-trip time of a light signal. To avoid invoking simultaneity at a distance, mirrors \origg{Spiegel} at $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ reflect the signal back to the same point $O$, and the round-trip time determines the distance. The Michelson experiment tests this: if the arms $OS_1$ and $OS_2$ (\cref{mv}) are equal in terms of round-trip light time ($\overline{OS_1O} = \overline{OS_2O}$), they are also equal when measured by rigid rods ($S_1 = S_2$). 

%The null result of the \MME confirmed this equality and was widely accepted. Further support came from Rudolf~\citet{Tomaschek1924}, a critic of relativity influenced by Philipp Lenard, who repeated the interferometer experiment using starlight \rc{39}{180}.


 
% The experiment was meant to test whether the rods satisfy the light-geometrical definition of length in every inertial system:  $OS_{1}=OS_{2}$ when  $\overline{O S_{1} O}=\overline{O S_{2} O}$. According to classical theory, the equality is satisfied only in ether system}


%However, in \datemy{5}{10}{1922}, Weyl informed him of a significant flaw in his axiomatization \citep{Rynasiewicz2005}: it was not possible to distinguish the class of inertial frames solely based on light rays as Reichenbach as claimed \letterhrp{Weyl}{Reichenbach}{5}{10}{1922}[015-68-02]. The book,

By limiting itself to logical structure, philosophy avoids empirical refutation but loses its grip on reality. Reichenbach ends by paraphrasing Einstein’s famous \citeyear{Einstein1921} dictum: \s{If the principles of epistemology refer to reality, they are not certain; and if they are certain, they do not refer to reality} \citep[**]{Reichenbach1922


%In the book, Reichenbach shared with \citet{Schlick1918} the idea that physical knowledge is, ultimately \s{coordination} (\german{Zuordnung}), the process of relating an axiomatically defined mathematical structure to concrete empirical reality \citep{Padovani2009}. However, Reichenbach attempted to give this insight a \scare{Kantian} twist. According to Reichenbach, in a physical theory, besides the \scare{axioms of connections} (\german{Verknüpfungsaxiome}) encoding the mathematical structure of a theory, one needs a special class of physical principles, the \scare{axioms of coordination} (\german{Zuordnungsaxiome}), to ensure the univocal coordination of that structure to reality. 

%In the book, \citet[chap.~IV]{Reichenbach1920a} shared with \citet{Schlick1918} the idea that physical knowledge is, ultimately \s{coordination} (\german{Zuordnung}), the process of relating an axiomatically defined mathematical structure to concrete empirical reality \citep{Padovani2009}. However, he attempted to give this insight a \scare{Kantian} twist, by searching for the conditions \apr for that make this coordination univocal \citep[chap.~VII]{Reichenbach1920a}. For the young Reichenbach, these coordinating principles are \apr because they are \scare{constitutive} of the object of a physical theory. However, they are not apodeictic or valid for all time \citep[chap.~V]{Reichenbach1920a}.

%For a long time, the debate—rooted in logical empiricism—framed the role of \rac in \rt in terms of \textit{confirmation}, as a dispute between empiricism and conventionalism. Since Brown's work, the center of gravity has shifted toward the problem of \textit{explanation} of the behavior of \rac, recasting the discussion as a conflict between dynamical and geometrical approaches.

%Reichenbach denied the explanatory power to \Mink \spti, and argued that \sr requires the behavior of \rac to be explained by a specific, though still unknown, theory of matter. His proposal fell flat and has been largely forgotten \citep[see, however][]{Gruenbaum1955,Gruenbaum1963a}; indeed, most of his readers have focused on his well-known conventional $\epsilon$-definition of simultaneity. 



%For Reichenbach, the fact that the laws governing the field and those governing matter agree is a \textit{coincidence} that requires an \textit{explanation}.  Einstein's strategy was to transform this \textit{coincidence}, revealed by the failure of all ether-drift experiments, into a \textit{requirement} that all laws of nature must satisfy. This is the sense of \citets{Einstein1919} famous comparison between relativity and \th. Classical \th asks: How must the laws of nature be constructed in order to rule out the possibility of bringing about perpetual motion of the first kind? The laws of nature must satisfy energy conservation. \Rt asks: How must the laws of nature be constructed in order to rule out the possibility of bringing about the ether wind? The laws of nature must be Lorentz invariant. 



%


%\Sr does not need to \emph{find} an \emph{actual} constructive Lorentz invariant theory of matter describing the behavior of rods and clocks; it is sufficient to \emph{require} that all \emph{possible} constructive theory, whatever they might be, are Lorentz invariant.

%However, such a theory would be an \emph{instantiation} of Einstein's new kinematics, not an \emph{explanation} of the latter.

According to Einstein, Minkowski’s contribution was to have developed a vector calculus that helps to check whether a theory is actually Lorentz invariant, without the need to carry out the transformations by sheer calculation.

%Einstein neither embraced \Mink's claim to have provided a \emph{geometrical explanation}. However, Einstein did not feel the need for a \emph{dynamical explanation}; indeed, he more or less explicitly emphasized that this was the advantage of his approach over Lorentz’s. 

%Lorentz’s theory stands or falls with his \emph{particular} Lorentz-invariant theory of matter and radiation. Thus, it needed to hypothesize about the structure of matter, the nature of molecular forces, etc. Einstein’s theory, by contrast, requires that \emph{any} theory of matter or radiation must be Lorentz invariant. Thus, no such detailed assumptions were needed. Certainly, setting up a new kinematics is not sufficient. Ultimately, one must complete the theory by searching for the particular theory of matter and radiation that happens to hold in nature; the equations of such theory might have solutions corresponding to material systems that we can use as \rac, thereby closing the circle. However, such a theory would be an \emph{instantiation} of Einstein's new kinematics, not an \emph{explanation} of the latter.

%Reichenbach, so to speak, \s{puts asunder what God hath joined together}.



 
%Reichenbach concluded that while Lorentz provided a bad dynamical explanation, Einstein provided no explanation at all, and thus his theory was still incomplete. 

%He argued that also in special relativity we needed a future \emph{dynamical explanation}, that is, to find a specific theory of matter that explains why \rac exhibit relativistic behavior. However, this indeed misses the point. 



%


%In both cases, the demand for an explanation and a detailed theory adds nothing further to the explanation itself. This characteristic can also be extended to general relativity. General relativity imposes fundamental constraints on any possible theory of matter and fields: (1) the laws must be generally covariant (\gc); (2) second derivatives of \gmn must not enter into the field equations (minimal coupling). If one asks why the gravitational field is a universal force—that is, why it affects \rac of any material in the same way—the explanation is that the components of the Riemann tensor do not explicitly enter into the formulation of the laws governing the material systems we use as rods and clocks. In this sense, they \s{adjust} to the gravitational field. Also in this case, we have an \emph{explanation by constraint}. Finding a particular theory of matter that satisfies this requirement does not add further explanatory value.

%The difference between the two contractions is clear: Lorentz contraction means that the world-strip of the relativistic length is shorter than that of the classical length in the same system $K'$. On this both, theories agrees. Einstein’s contraction refers to the fact that the same shorter strip can be in a different way by the plane of simultaneity, that is by horizontal space axis of \Mink diagram if the rod $K'$ or $K$: 

%Einstein could achieve this result, by introducing \emph{by convetion} a new definition of length, which requires measurement at the same time. In this setting, identical rigid rods, measured the distance between different points: with respect to the co-moving frame $K'$  the end points $O$ and $S^{\prime}$ of a moving bar are simultaneous; with respect to rest frame $K$, $O$ and $S_{1}$ are:

%A lightlike line in a Minkowski diagram has equal projections onto the space and time axes when using units where \( c = 1 \). Rods and clocks at rest in a moving system measure the same speed of light as those at rest in the original frame. Even when lengths and times are projected differently due to relative motion, the ratio of distance to time—used to measure the speed of light—remains \( c \).

%by adopting Einstein's conventional definition of simultaneity one could still claim that the motion of light is a spherical wave for any uniformly moving system. Also the assertion that that the velocity of light as a \emph{limiting} velocity could also be maintained. Indeed, this empirical fact is confirmed by measurements on fast traveling electrons ($\beta$ rays), whose kinetic energy approaches infinity as their velocity nears the speed of light. The assertion the velocity of light has always a \emph{numerical value} $c$, if measured by \rac on the contrary would be refuted.


\hide{We have now succeeded in distinguishing between the physical assertions of the relativistic theory of space and time and its epistemological foundation. This epistemological foundation is supplied by the discovery that coordinative definitions are needed far more ... The physical core of the theory, however, consists of the hypothesis that natural measuring instruments follow coordinative definitions different from those assumed in the classical theory. This statement is, of course, empirical. On its truth depends only the p11ysic1tl theory of relativity. However, the philosophical theory of relativity, i.e., the discovery of the definitional character of the metric in all its details, holds independently of experience. Although it was developed in connection with physical experiments, it constitutes a philosophical result not subject to the criticism of the individual sciences.}

%A few months later, Reichenbach submitted a popular paper on the Miller's experiment entitled \citefulltitle{Reichenbach1926a} which appeared in the weekly magazine \citejournal{Reichenbach1926a} in \datemy{24}{4}{1926}. By that time, Reichenbach was fully aware of what \qt{Einstein himself has recently said in the newspapers,}{Einstein selbst hat k\"{u}rzlich in den Tageszeitungen ausgesprochen}; however, he saw no reason to abandon his \qt{less radical opinion}{eine weniger radikale Ansicht entwickelt} \crw{327}{202}, namely that \qt{\myemph{Miller's result in no way affects the philosophical consequences of the theory of relativity}}{Auf keinen fall werden jedoch die philosophischen Konsequenzen der Relativit\"atstheorie von den Millerschen Versuchen betroffen} \crw{328}{203\me}. It would only imply a change in our knowledge of the physical mechanism governing rods and clocks \citep[308]{Hentschel1982}.


%How can this negative result be explained? Classical aether theory attempted to account for it by postulating that the aether is dragged along with the Earth in its orbit. However, this stratagem contradicts the phenomenon of stellar aberration \crw{**}{**}. As a result, 19th-century optics found itself in a seemingly irresolvable dilemma. According to Reichenbach, the standard view in physics was to preserve the existence of a stationary aether by introducing auxiliary hypotheses—such as length contraction—to explain why the experiment yielded no observable effect.

%According to Reichenbach, the received view of how physics attempted to resolve this puzzle was as follows: the equality holds in all frames.

%This principle must now be formulated in a more exact manner. The velocity of light is identical in all directions in a uniformly moving frame of reference, provided simultaneity is correspondingly defined. This additional


%When moving uniformly through the ether with velocity $v$ with respect to the ether frame $K$ (in which light propagates rectilinearly with velocity $c$), the arm $\mathrm{OS}_2$ shrinks in the direction of its motion, just as a metal bar contracts when exposed to cold, and this compensates for the slower speed of light rays in that direction—accounting for the null result of the experiment. The deformation of the rod cannot be ascertained by measurement—for instance, by rotating the non-contracted $\mathrm{OS}_1$ around $O$ to check whether $S_{1}$ can be brought into coincidence with $S_{2}$. Indeed, in this case, $\mathrm{OS}_1$ would also be contracted by the same amount as $\mathrm{OS}_2$. Thus, Lorentz justified the contraction hypothesis on the grounds that the molecular forces which hold material bodies together are electromagnetic in nature and are affected by translational motion. Lorentz could then conclude that there exists an aether wind over the surface of the Earth, but it is not detectable.


%Whereas in Einstein's original theory of relativity light served merely to determine simultaneity, it became clear in later developments of the theory that light can be used for all measurements of time—for defining the unit of time, and even for the measurement of space. One may construct a geometry of light in which light determines the comparison of spatial distances. Thus, light comes to function as the ordering framework of physics, gathering within the mesh of its rays all the events of the world and arranging them in numerical order.

%According to this interpretation the measurement of space can be reduced to the measurement of time; spatial distance can be measured by the time needed for a light signal to travel a certain segment.  Definition of the equality of spatial distances in terms of measurements of time intervals.




%Although his attempt fell flat and has been mostly forgotten \citep[see, however][]{Gruenbaum1955,Gruenbaum1963a}, Reichenbach should be considered the foremost forerunner of the \emph{dynamical} interpretation of relativity. According to the usual interpretation, Reichenbach provided a conventionalist reading of special relativity. He addressed the issue of \emph{coordination} between the abstract mathematical structure of relativity and the behavior of material systems like light rays and \rac, arguing that the definition of simultaneity is conventional. This interpretation is not incorrect but partial. Reichenbach was the first to engage explicitly with the problem of \emph{explanation} for the fact that the relativistic behavior of material systems like \rac. According to Reichenbach, Lorentz theory is inadequate as it provides a \emph{bad explanation} of this behavior in terms of the deviation from a standard classical behavior of \rac. However, Einstein theory also falls short by offering \emph{no explanation} of this and simply by asserting by decree that theory relativistic behavior is of \rac the standard behavior. Reichenbach argues that also in \sr, a \textit{proper explanation} is required. A geometrical explanation, he argued, was no more than a graphical illustration; thus a proper explanation must be a dynamical rooted in a yet unknown theory of matter.

It is, however, important to briefly reconstruct it, since his goal is precisely to show that the conventional presentation is incorrect. As is well known, the essential idea of the experiment was to test whether the speed of light is the same in all directions relative to the Earth's motion through the ether. The reader would find \textcites{Reichenbach1924}{Reichenbach1926a} offer a quite conventional account; however, this is important since Reichenbach's goal is precisely to show that the conventional presentation is wrong. In the setup, a beam of light is split at point $O$ by a semi-transparent mirror, sending two coherent beams along two perpendicular arms of equal length, each terminating at mirrors $M_1$ and $M_2$. The beams are reflected back to $O$ and recombined to produce an interference pattern. The experiment tests whether the round-trip travel time depends on the apparatus's orientation relative to the Earth's motion through the ether. If light speed varied with direction, rotating the device would shift the interference fringes \rw{325}{195f.}. According to ether theory, the beams return together only if the apparatus is at rest with respect to the ether. Since the Earth moves through the ether, the theory predicts a \s{deviation}: the beam toward $M_2$ returns slightly later, shifting the fringes. Thus, the interference pattern could reveal the Earth's absolute motion through the ether.

The Einstein rod would be shorter. The difference could be measured in $S$ as the difference between their rest-lengths, and in any other system as the difference between the lengths of the moving rods. Einstein's theory as well as Lorentz's theory therefore assumes the behavior of rigid rods to be measurably different from their behavior according to classical theory; but the difference has nothing to do with the definition of simultaneity}.

%In the booklet, Reichenbach, like \citet{Schlick1918} conceives physical knowledge as (\emph{Zuordnung}), the process of relating an axiomatically defined mathematical structure to concrete empirical reality \citep{Padovani2009}. However, Reichenbach attempted to give this insight a \scare{Kantian} twist. According to Reichenbach, in a physical theory, besides the \scare{axioms of connections} (\german{Verknüpfungsaxiome}) encoding the mathematical structure of a theory, one needs a special class of physical principles, the \scare{axioms of coordination} (\german{Zuordnungsaxiome}), to ensure the univocal coordination of that structure to reality. For young Reichenbach, the latter axioms are \apr because they are \scare{constitutive} of the object of a physical theory. However, they are not apodeictic or valid for all time \citep{Padovani2009}.

%
%
%We do not know whether Reichenbach ever became aware of Schlick's negative opinion of his interpretation of \sr. However he clearly did not made any conciliatory steps.  Reichenbach's line of argument can be found again in the \citetitle{Reichenbach1928} \citep{Reichenbach1928}, which, as a letter from Reichenbach to Schlick reveals, was already finished at the end of 1926 (\letter{Reichenbach}{Schlick}{6}{12}{1926}[][SN]), though Reichenbach was only able to find a publisher months later. When the book was finally published that the beginning of 1928 the importance of Miller's experiment was fading away especially in Germany. However, Reichenbach's stance is of course not changed. There is no difference between Einstein and Loretnz theory. Lorentz provided a bad explanato Einstein did not provide any explanation. 
%
%
%
%%The distinctive role of light in the theory of relativity can be expressed in another way. While in Einstein's original formulation of relativity, light was used primarily to define simultaneity, the later refinement of the theory revealed that light could serve as the basis for all measurements of time and the measurement of space. One could construct a \s{light geometry}. The physical tools for measuring time and space play only a secondary role. The Lorentz-Einstein theory claims that, magnetic needle aligning itself with the magnetic field, they adapt to the geometry of light, \rac adapt to the relativistic light geometry. The difference between Lorentz and Einstein is that where that a deflection from the true classical light geometry, Einstein from the declare the relativistic light geometry to be are rigid. By that of time and depend length interval matter on the same definition of simultaneity as light geometry: \q{This idea can be expressed mathematically by bringing together space and time into a four-dimensional structure, into a space-time manifold} 112.  
%
%
%
%One might argue that not Einstein but \Mink provied such explanation, dynamical but a geometrical explaation. The name of \Mink is surprisingly never mentioned in his 1924 book. The most improta how the content of the light- and matter-axioms can be \q{visualized geometrically} by the world- geometry of \Mink. Reichenbach views \Mink-\spti  as nothing but a \scare{graphical representation}, an expression he borrowed from Arthur Stanley \citet{Eddington1925a}. Reichenbach defines \scare{graphical representations} as structural analogies between different physical systems (e.g., compressed gases, electrical phenomena, mechanical forces, rigid bodies and light rays, etc.), which are realizations of the same conceptual system (e.g., the axioms of Euclidean geometry) \rzl{123ff}{101ff}. In the case of Minkowski space-time, if \qt{we speak of a geometrization of physical events, this phrase should not be understood in some mysterious sense; it refers to the identity of types of \emph{structure} and not to the \emph{identity of the coordinated physical elements}}{Wenn man von einer Geometrisierung des Weltgeschehens gesprochen hat, so darf dies auf keinen Fall in irgendeinem geheimnisvollen Sinn aufgefaßt werden; es besagt nur die Identitat von Strukturtypen, nicht der zugeordneten dinglichen Elemente.} \rzl{220}{190}. By asserting that measuring rods, clocks, and light rays behave according to the relations of congruence of the indefinite metric, Minkowski space-time provides the geometrical representation of the light and matter axioms. When in \cref{mr} we \scare{symbolize}, say, the motion of rod $OS$ with its rotation of the segment around $O$, \qt{we only g\textins{ive} a graphical representation, which means that the logical structure \origins{Beziehungsgef\"{u}ge} exhibited by the rods \textelp can also be realized by the space-time manifold}{so wird sie nur graphisch dargestellt; es wird damit behauptet, da§ das Beziehungsgef\"{u}ge, welches r\"aumliche St\"abe von der Art des vorangehenden \S~28 enthalten, zugleich auch; von der Raum-Zeit-Mannigfaltigkeit realisiert wird.} \rzl{220}{190}.

%
%
%The advance of this logical structure, Einstein only because, he redefined the length of simultaneity that it became advantageous to combine space-time into a single geometrical structure, that is a four-dimensional manifold, that \Mink called the \scare{World} or \st (\S24). This simply means that it takes four numbers, the so-called \emph{coordinates}, $x_\nu$ (where $\nu=1,2,3,4$) to identify a \wpo, namely three numbers $x_1,x_2,x_3$ for its spatial location and one for time $x_4$. The set of points whose coordinates are defined by $x_\nu(s)$ where $s$ is an arbitrary parameter is called a \wl{}. At this stage, coordinates $x_\nu$ are nothing but identification numbers, that is, in Reichenbach's parlance, they have only a \scare{topological} function; they determine the order of the \emph{between} relation. In order to define distances between points, one needs to introduce an expression that assigns a number $ds$ to the coordinate differences $dx_\nu$ between two close \wpo{}s, the so-called \scare{fundamental metrical form}. In the case of \Mink \spti, it is always possible to choose the coordinate numbers \xn so that any distance satisfies the relation.

%%
%This metrical (that is \scare{measurement}) formula allows to calculate the distance $ds$ between two nearby points from their coordinate differences $dx_\nu$. A metric that has positive as well as negative signs is called \scare{indefinite} \rzlp{**}{188--189}. The physical realization of the negative $\diff s^2$ is a physical object that satisfies the relations of congruence defined by the hyperbolas of quadrants \rom{1} and \rom{2}. The realization of the positive $\diff s^2$ is a physical object that satisfies the relations of congruence defined by the hyperbolas of quadrants \rom{3} and \rom{4}. The first is called a time-like interval $\diff s^2 = -1$ and is realized by the proper time of a clock. The rotation of the interval $OQ$ into the position $OQ'$ represents a moving clock. $\diff s^2 = 1$ is the space-like interval and is realized by the proper length of a rod. The rotation of interval $OS$ into $OS'$ sets the rod into motion. Light rays realirze $\diff s^2 = 0$, the limiting velocity, which cannot be reached but only approached arbitrarily closely. Otherwise rods and clocks behave by following the hyperbolic contour lines.
%
%%As Reichenbach rightly notices, there is a deep disanalogy between clocks and rods. Clocks are intrinsically four-dimensional measuring instruments, since they measure distances between two events. Measuring rods, on the other hand, are three-dimensional measuring instruments; they can be treated as four-dimensional instruments, if events are produced at their endpoints according to the appropriate definition of simultaneity \rzl{217}{187}. It is from this difference that all difficulties arise concerning the behavior of rods.

%In Minkowski space-time the history of a uniformly moving unit rod is represented by a world-strip bounded by the parallel world-lines of the rod's endpoints. In the Lorentz-Einstein theory---keeping in mind that the points on the hyperbolas are at distance $1$ from $O$---the moving rod is represented by the narrower strip between the world-lines $OQ'$ and $S_1S'$; according to the classical theory it is represented by the wider strip between $OQ'$ and $SS'_2$. The Einstein contraction maintains that the moving rod $OS'=1$ looks shorter from the perspective of the rest frame ($OS_1$) than the proper length of the rod $OS=1$ (\lK{}{'}<\lK{}{}). The Lorentz contraction refers to the fact that the classical length $OS'_2$ would be longer than the relativistic proper length $OS'=1$, if both were measured in the same moving frame (\lK{'}{'}<\LK{'}{'}) \rzl{225}{195}.
%
%
%%In geometrical terms, the Einstein contraction compares the width of different three-dimensional simultaneity cross-sections of the same relativistic world-strip (it is a perspectival difference); the Lorentz contraction compares the width of same three-dimensional cross-section of different world-strips (it is a real difference). \Cref{mr} reflects the fact that in the classical theory there is neither a Einstein nor a Lorentz contraction ($OS=OS_2=OS'_2$). In the Lorentz-Einstein theory the Einstein contraction is  Lorentz contraction ($OS'_1<OS'_2 \rightarrow OS_1<OS$). However, the two contractions are not identical. (a) the length of the moving rod $\lK{}{'}$ measured from the rest frame is different from its proper length $\lK{}{}$. The rest-length of the moving rod $\lK{'}{'}$ is different from the rest-length of another rod $\LK{'}{'}$ which moves with it but satisfies the classical theory. 
%%
%%In Reichenbach's view, (b) can either be \scare{true} or \scare{false} in both Lorentz and Einstein's theories, depending on whether one accepts, say, Michelson or Miller's experimental results. In the geometrical representation, it is indicated by the difference between the distances $\lK{'}{'}=OS'$ and $\LK{'}{'}=OS'^2$ (\cref{mr}). On the contrary, (a) is neither \scare{true} nor \scare{false}; it depends on the definition of simultaneity adopted (one can choose the standard Einsteinian definition or an alternative one). In the geometrical representation, statement (a) is equivalent to the comparison of $\lK{}{}=OS$ and $\lK{}{'}=OS'$. 
%%
%%Lorentz believed that lengths mentioned in (a) are different because the lengths mentioned in (b) are: the lengths of the arms of the interferometer are equally long only in the ether frame. On the contrary, Einstein declared the lengths mentioned in (a) are equal if measured at relative rest: the proper lengths of the arms of the interferometer are the same in all inertial frames \rzl{229--230}{198--199}. Reichenbach, however, made a further statement embodying the peculiarity of his approach: \qt{\myemph{It is sometimes overlooked by proponents of the theory of relativity that statement (b) is nevertheless true}}{dagegen wird von relativistischer Seite gewohnlich ?bersehen, da§ trotzdem die Behauptung b gilt} \rzl{230}{198} in Einstein's theory as well.
%%
%%To sjow, Reichenbach repeats the proof of this statement, as it appeared in his 1925 article \rzl{230f.}{199f.}; however, in order to emphasize the difference between the two contractions, he constructs a counterexample in which an \scare{Einstein contraction} appears but there is no \scare{Lorentz contraction}. The example is based on the possibility of using Einstein's definition of simultaneity or an alternative one ($\epsilon \neq \nicefrac{1}{2}$) in the classical theory \rzl{231}{200}. Reichenbach's conclusion can be understood without entering into too much detail:
%
%\qrz{The example \textelp makes it particularly clear that the Einstein contraction is a metrogenic phenomenon. In the geometrical representation this means that we may choose as the length of the rod differently directed sections through the world-strip of the rod. On the other hand, the geometrical representation of [\cref{mr}] shows very clearly that through the difference in the width of the strip, the Lorentz contraction indicates a difference in the actual behavior of the rod. These considerations also explain how it is possible to compare rods $I$ and $L$, although only one of them is physically realized. $OS$ is the same in both theories; the classical theory claims that the right-hand boundary of the strip parallel to $OQ'$ must be drawn through $S$, whereas the new theory places the boundary along the tangent to the hyperbola which passes through $S'$}{Gerade dieses Beispiel \textelp macht es besonders deutlich, daß die EinsteinVerk\"{u}rzung eine metrogene Erscheinung ist; es kommt in der geometrischen Darstellung darauf' hinaus, daß man als L\"ange des Stabes verschieden gerichtete Schnitte durch den Weltstreifen des Stabes ausw\"ahlt. Andrerseits zeigt die geometrische Darstellung der Fig. 32 (S. 215) deutlieh, daß die LorentzVerk\"{u}rzung mit dem Unterschied der Streifenbreiten einen Unterschied des realen Verhaltens betrifft. Auch erkennt man hier, wie es \"{u}berhaupt m?glich ist, die St\"abe $l$ und $L$ zu vergleichen, obgleich nur der eine von ihnen realisiert ist: die Strecke OS ist f\"{u}r beide Theorien dieselbe; die alte Theorie behauptet, daß die rechte, zu $OQ'$ parallele Begrenzung des Streifens durch S gezogen werden muß, w\"ahrend die neue Theorie behauptet, daß diese Begrenzung als Tangente an die durch $S$ gehende Hyperbel gezogen werden muß}[232][200]
%
%Thus it is correct to claim that the Einstein contraction does not require any physical explanation; it is a metrogenic difference between proper and coordinate length. However, Lorentz's contraction \emph{does} cry out for such an explanation. The negative result of the Michelson experiment implies that rods of all materials invariably behave in agreement with distances measured by light rays. How can such a coincidence be explained? As we have seen, for Reichenbach, Weyl's expression \scare{adjustment} aptly expresses the need for an explanation, but it provides no details as to what it would look like. \qt{The answer can of course be given only by a detailed theory of matter, of which we have not the least idea}{Die Antwort kann nat\"{u}rlich nur eine ausgef\"{u}hrte Theorie der Materie geben, von der wir noch nicht die leiseste Vorstellung besitzen} \crz{233}{201\tm}. It is important to emphasize that this is not a marginal aspect of Reichenbach's philosophy. According to Reichenbach the very same problem emerges in \gr when the non-Euclidean nature of the continuum is taken into account. In this case, too, he resorts to the expression \scare{adjustment} and he refers his readers to the very same \S31 of the book.  Here the adjustment means is grapjicall that rod follows the contour of the ellipsi, instand of that of the parlall lines. On this fact both EInstein and Lorentz theory agree.

%The advance of this logical structure, Einstein only because, he redefined the length of simultaneity that it became advantageous to combine space-time into a single geometrical structure, that is a four-dimensional manifold, that \Mink called the \scare{World} or \st (\S24). This simply means that it takes four numbers, the so-called \emph{coordinates}, $x_\nu$ (where $\nu=1,2,3,4$) to identify a \wpo, namely three numbers $x_1,x_2,x_3$ for its spatial location and one for time $x_4$. The set of points whose coordinates are defined by $x_\nu(s)$ where $s$ is an arbitrary parameter is called a \wl{}.

%%Such \s{Minkowski diagrams} can be extremely helpful and illuminating in certain types of relativistic problems. For example, one can often use them to get a rough preliminary idea of the answer.

Carnap had just joined the Schlick circle in Vienna. The philosophical disagreement between the Schlick-Circle and Reichenbach was deepening and went beyond the specific issue of the philosophical interpretation of \sr. Reichenbach was convinced that the philosophy of nature should tackle metaphysical questions, such as that of the reality of the external world or of the human freedom \citep{Reichenbach1926b}. By contrast, Schlick, influenced by the young Carnap and Ludwig Wittgenstein deemed all such metaphysical questions as non-sensical \citep{Schlick1926}.

%Yet it should not be believed that that the relativistic concept of time would be false. As I have shown in the former report, this time can be defined purely in terms of the light geometry without using natural clocks and rigid measuring rods. Since definitions are arbitrary, the two times are equally justified. Independent of all empirical verification it can therefore be said: if there were an absolute time, it would no longer be absolute.

%In the meantime, Reichenbach thanks Max Planck's and and Max von Laue's support, had obtained the chair for natural philosophy in Berlin (\letter{Reichenbach}{Schlick}{2}{7}{1926}; \letter{Schlick}{Reichenbach}{5}{7}{1926}).

%\cop{We see that the locus of the philosophical difference between Lorentz and Einstein has been misplaced by the proponents of the ad hoc charge against Lorentz. To understand Einstein’s philosophical innovation, we must take cognizance of the fact that the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction hypothesis was not the only addition to the ether theory made by Lorentz in order to account for the available body of experimental data. Since the horizontal arm of the Michelson-Morley experiment is shorter than a rod lying alongside it but conforming to the expectations of classical light geometry, we must infer that when a unit rod in the ether system is transported to a moving system, it can no longer be a true unit rod but becomes shorter than unity in the moving system, and similarly for clocks. The deviation from the classically expected behavior exhibited by rods and clocks must have a cause in the sense of being due to a perturbational influence.}

%Einstein realized that the length of this rod in the moving system can be legitimately decreed by definition, and similarly for the periods of material clocks, then it would have been clear to him that the ground is cut from under his distinction between \s{true} and \s{local} (i.e., spurious) lengths and times and thereby from his idea that the horizontal arms. the \s{natural} behavior of things is indeed different from what the theory in question has been supposing it to be and that (b) deviations from the assumedly natural behavior transpire without perturbational causes. Thus Einstein declared as rigid the conform to the relativistic light geometry. To this purpose it need, the \s{Einstein contraction}, that is that definition of simultaneity that that the \s{moving length} in the moving system is shorter than the \s{rest length}. The effect disappears, if the comoving observer. However, the effect is real, in the sense, that at the same time, the measuring one would indeed, shorted. That the natural behavior rods.

%If one renounces the demand for the Kleinian perspective, and thus understands by mapping onto the numerical space a bijective continuous mapping of the entire infinite world onto the complete numerical space, then the first condition alone—that every straight line must be transformed into a straight line—defines the world not only as a projective but also as an affine space. For the only projective mappings that transform finitely distant points into finitely distant points and infinitely distant points into infinitely distant points are the affine mappings. Conversely, the only spherical transformations that leave all points in the finite domain within the finite domain are the similarity transformations. Therefore, when operating with the entire infinite world, Minkowskian geometry can be completely built upon the single concept of the null element; the straight line becomes dispensable. This was carried out several years ago by the English mathematician Robb in a very cumbersome and artificial system of axioms. I refer to his book "Theory of Time and Space," published by Cambridge University Press, and the shorter presentation, also published there, "The Absolute Relations of Time and Space."

%In the previously mentioned report, the axioms are divided into light axioms, those that assert only the properties of light, and matter axioms, which assert the properties of rigid measuring rods and natural clocks.

%Through his attendance at Einstein's lectures in 1917/1918 and 1918/1919, he had acquired a detailed technical knowledge of the new theory, surpassing that of most philosophers of his time. The success of the eclipse expedition was announced in November 1919 \citep{Dyson1920}, Einstein was turned into an international celebrity. debate As a trained physicist with a doctorate in philosophy \citep{Reichenbach1916}, Reichenbach was uniquely positioned to engage with the philosophical implications of the theory. In February or March 1920, shortly after his move to Stuttgart, Reichenbach decided to make this topic the subject of his habilitation. According to his later recollections\footnote{These autobiographical notes \cite[044-06-23]{HR} were written in 1927}, in the preceding months, he had further worked on the theory. The Kapp-Pusch coup in \datemy{13}{3}{1920} rovided Reichenbach with a few days off from his job at the Huth radio industry  \citep[044-06-23]{HR}. This gave him the opportunity to work uninterrupted, and in just ten days, he completed an early draft of his habilitation. The manuscript was then typed and shown to Einstein and others. Thanks to the intervention of Arnold Berliner, the influential editor of \jt{Naturwisseschaften}, Reichenbach secured a publishing agreement with Springer \citep[044-06-23]{HR}.

%For the young Reichenbach, one of the main philosophical merits of the theory of relativity was the revelation of the physical character of geometry
%Reichenbach borrowed from \citet{Schlick1918} the idea that physical knowledge is, ultimately (\emph{Zuordnung}), the process of relating an axiomatically defined mathematical structure to concrete empirical reality \citep{Padovani2009}. However, Reichenbach attempted to give this insight a \scare{Kantian} twist. According to Reichenbach, in a physical theory, besides the \scare{axioms of connections} (\german{Verknüpfungsaxiome}) encoding the mathematical structure of a theory, one needs a special class of physical principles, the \scare{axioms of coordination} (\german{Zuordnungsaxiome}), to ensure the univocal coordination of that structure to reality. For the young Reichenbach, the latter axioms are \apr because they are \scare{constitutive} of the object of a physical theory. However, they are not apodeictic or valid for all time. As is well known, Reichenbach would soon abandon the project of a constitutive but relativized \apr. However, he would firmly maintain the separation between the mathematical framework of a theory (the \scare{defined side}) and the way it relates to empirical reality (the \scare{undefined side}) as an essential feature of his philosophy \rhp{40}{42} as an essential feature of his philosophy

%The aspect of Reichenbach's interpretation of \sr that has attracted the most attention is probably his famous conventionality of simultaneity---the freedom to choose which events are simultaneous in a given inertial frame depending on the value of the parameter $\epsilon$. In a classical paper, David \citet{Malament1977} has famously shown that one cannot allow such a freedom if one believes---as Reichenbach did---in the causal theory of time. Malament's paper, the epitome of an influential work, has generated an enormous amount of discussion \citep[cf.][sec. 4 for an overview]{Janis2014}. 
%
%More recently, however, Robert \citet{Rynasiewicz2003} has, as far I can see, rightly challenged this view, showing that the non-standard definitions of simultaneity, though possible, play a \q{disappointingly little \textins{role}}[][125][Rynasiewicz2003] in Reichenbach's formal construction \citep[see also][]{Rynasiewicz2012}. The present paper intends to show that, whatever stance one might take about this matter, there is another aspect of Reichenbach's interpretation of \sr that has gone unnoticed in recent literature, which is possibly more characteristic of his approach than the $\epsilon$-definition of simultaneity: Reichenbach's distinction between two types of rod contractions occurring in \sr, the Lorentz and Einstein contractions.
%
%Reichenbach introduced this distinction introduced this distinction in his discussion of Miller's experiment. In 1925 the American experimentalist Dayton C.~\citet{Miller1925} published the results of a series of Michelson-type experiments that he conducted at the top of Mount Wilson, in Southern California. Miller's \scare{scandalous} detection of an ether-drift sparked, as one would expect, considerable debate that well beyond the physics community about a possible refutation of \sr. The role of Miller experiment in the history of this experiment has been Einstein's attitude towards this experiment has been carefully investigated by Klaus \citet{Hentschel1992a}. The debate that ensued in the physics community, in particular in the American one has been nicely presented by \citep{Lalli2012-04}. However, the philosophical reception of the experiment among \scare{philosophers} is still to be written. This paper will like to close this gap in the literature.

%Reichenbach was the first to join the debate by publishing a paper the same year \citep{Reichenbach1925}, intending to demonstrate the physical implications of his axiomatization of \sr. The peculiarity of Reichenbach's approach can be inferred from remarks that Moritz Schlick sent to Einstein at the end of 1925 (\letter{Schlick}{Einstein}{27}{12}{1925}[21-591][EA]; cf. \cite[361f.]{Hentschel1990}).  To his surprise, Schlick found conclusions in Reichenbach's paper that could not have been further from his own. Reichenbach did not believe that the Lorentz contraction was an \latin{ad hoc} hypothesis and that Einstein had dispelled \citep[see][on this issue]{Janssen2002}; he believed the contraction needed a dynamical explanation based on a theory of matter in \sr, just like in Lorentz's theory. Thus Schlick realized that for Reichenbach there were no differences between Lorentz and Einstein's theories, and therefore no conventional choice between them. Moreover, the acceptance of Miller's results would not have implied a return to the old ether theory. By reading Schlick's letter, one is immediately disabused of the conviction that Reichenbach's axiomatization was a mathematically sophisticated version of Schlick's conventionalist reading of \sr.
%
%Reichenbach's line of argument was based on the above mentioned distinction between \scare{Lorentz contraction} and \scare{Einstein contraction}, which would resurface in his major 1928 monograph \citep{Reichenbach1928}. In a slightly updated parlance, one can say that the Lorentz contraction compares the proper length of a moving rod in \sr with the length that the rod would have had in the classical theory; the Einstein contraction compares the proper length of a relativistic rod with its coordinate length in a moving frame. The first contraction implies a real difference and requires a molecular-atomistic explanation in both Einstein and Lorentz's theories. The second contraction is a perspectival difference that depends on the definition of simultaneity. Reichenbach holds the controversial opinion that only the first contraction is necessary to explain the Michelson experiment. 
%
%The aim of this paper to show how it was Reichenbach's reaction to Miller's experiment that prompted him to introduce this distinction. \Cref{ax} of this paper presents a sketch of Reichenbach's axiomatization of \sr, which is indispensable to understanding his line of argument. \Cref{lcec} introduces the distinction between Lorentz and Einstein contractions. \Cref{me} shows how Reichenbach uses the distinction to provide a philosophical account of Miller's experiment. \Cref{mc} follows Reichenbach's \scare{geometrization} of the opposition between Lorentz/Einstein-contraction in terms of Minkowski diagrams, as presented in his 1928 book. The paper concluded by showing, that Reichenbach's distinction was resurrected by Adolf Gr\"unbaum in the 1950s, that use it against Karl Popper's claim that the Lorentz contraction was not falsifiable. 
%
%
%Nevertheless, it was Reichenbach who must be credited for having attempted to show that the Lorentz-Einstein relationship should not be understood along the lines of the ad hoc/non ad-hoc distinction. According Reichenbach both theories attempt to account for an odd coincidence, that matter and fields contract in the same way (that is in Reichenbach's parlance the light geometry and matter geometry agree). Lorentz explained the difference as a deviation from a standard behavior for rods and clocks. Einstein, by contrast refused to give an explanation and simply declared that the relativistic behavior to be the natural behavior of rods and clocks. According to Reichenbach, however, an explanation is needed in Einstein theory as well. Surprisingly, in Reichenbach's view the explanation is not to be searched in the geometrical structure of space-time \citep{Janssen2009}, but in a theory of the material structure of rods and clocks. In this sense, Reichenbach approach appears as a curious anticipation of a neo-Lorentzian approach to \sr \citet{Brown2005}.

% but a non-trivial one or rods and clocks. What is surprising respect to the current debate. In their common origin, that forces of all types must transform alike because they inhabit the same space and time \citep{Janssen2002}{Janssen2002a}. 

%After the correspondence with Schlick and his consequent “conventionalist shift”, around the end of 1920, Reichenbach no longer talks about constitutive principles. The first development of this discussion is apparent in a report that he deliv- ered at the Deutsche Physikertag in Jena, in September 1921, on his plan to ax- iomatise relativity theory.45 The fundamental methodological innovation of this short paper is to present an axiomatisation in which the starting point consists of making use of axioms that can ideally make direct contact with empirical (or ex- perimentally testable) facts, and of complementing them by introducing a number of coordinative definitions for the construction of the conceptual content of the theory.

%%The type of explanation Reichenbach refers to is geometrical rather than dynamical. The Lorentz contraction behaves according to dynamical principles, while the Einstein contraction follows the geometrical framework of light geometry.  The geometrical explanation is not violated by experimental results, as it ensures that optical and tactile measurements agree—a coincidence that Bridgman refers to as fundamental. Reichenbach explains that this agreement aligns with Minkowski space-time, providing a unified explanation of matter consistent with the theory of relativity. However, what Lorentz's explanation misses, according to Reichenbach, is the requirement for invariance under the principles of relativity. Lorentz's approach introduces constraints that lead to contradictions with the first postulate of relativity, which is grounded in experimental results. Without Lorentz invariance, the theoretical framework would collapse like a deck of cards.

%\begin{comment}

%The part $B$ of the last chapter of \PRZL is dedicated to \gr. Reichenbach introduced the problem of gravitation from a physical point of as the passage from Newton's scalar theory of gravity based on a the single potential $\varphi$ to Einstein's theory of gravitation based on the multi-component object $\gmn$ (\S\S34--38). To clarify the nature of the latter mathematical object, in \S39 Reichenbach offered a didactic presentation of \q{the analytic treatment of the problem of space that was introduced by Riemann and Gauss} \rzlp{**}{242}. Reichenbach's starts from the two-dimensional case and then extends his results to four-dimensions. To slightly shorten our presentation, however, I will directly start to latter case. 
%
%As is well known, \rt has forced us to combine space and time into a four-dimensional manifold, that \Mink called the\scare{World} or \st (\S24). This simply means that it takes four numbers, the so-called \emph{coordinates}, $x_\nu$ (where $\nu=1,2,3,4$) to identify a \wpo, namely three numbers $x_1,x_2,x_3$ for its spatial location and one for time $x_4$. The set of points whose coordinates are defined by $x_\nu(s)$ where $s$ is an arbitrary parameter is called a \wl{}. At this stage, coordinates $x_\nu$ are nothing but identification numbers, that is, in Reichenbach's parlance, have only a \scare{topological} function, they determine the order of the \emph{between} relation. In order to define distances between points, one needs to introduce an expression that assigns a number $ds$ to the coordinate differences $dx_\nu$ between two close \wpo{}s, the so-called the \scare{fundamental metrical form}. In the case of \Mink \spti, it is always possible to choose the coordinate numbers \xn so that any distance satisfies the relation:


%According to Reichenbach, however, the choice \emph{among} Riemannian geometries (Euclidean and non-Euclidean), remains a matter of convention. Let's say that, by using \rac, one has found a certain set of \gmn in a certain set of polar coordinates \polart, say, $\gmn=g^S\mn$ as in \cref{eq:polarscharzschild}. \rite does not vanish, and, therefore, the geometry of \spti is non-Euclidean. However, to avoid this consequence, we could still claim that the rod along the radial $r$ is not rigid, but it is shorted by $\sqrt{g_{11}}$, whereas a clock is slowed down by the factor $\sqrt{g_{44}}$ by some force that affects our measuring instruments. Thus, given a certain non-Euclidean \gmn, we can always reduce them to normal values \gmnbar by introducing suitable correction factors $C\mn$:
%
%\begin{equation*}
%\gmn =\gmnbar + C_{\mu\nu}\,.
%\end{equation*}
%%
%Thus, one can always introduce the distinction between a \scare{measurable but distorted} non-Euclidean \gmn  where $\rite \neq 0$ and the \scare{true but hidden} \Mink \gmnbar, where $\rite=0$.  $C\mn$ is a tensor field that can be interpreted as a real force field that, contrary to usual forces, affect all bodies in the same manner, that is, it is a universal force. Since this force, in principle, undetectable, we can \emph{decide} to set universal forces as equal to zero by definition\footnote{However, the idea of taking $C\mn$ as a real force is somewhat problematic. The force will deform our rods and clocks in a different way in different coordinate systems since the coefficients $\gmn$ are different. As a consequence, the force field will make the $ds$ not invariant. This objection was raised by \citet{Weyl1922c}. See also \cite{Norton1994}}. The metric of \st becomes an empirical fact only after the postulate of the disappearance of universal forces is introduced. Once a definition of congruence is given, the choice of the geometry is no longer in our hands; rather, the geometry is now an \emph{empirical fact}. In this sense, Reichenbach's philosophy of geometry is sometimes called a neo-conventionalism \citep[see also][ch.\ 8]{Reichenbach1953a}.


%Our reflection shows us that space-measurement and time on simultaneity. that is taht simultaneisy poi. To determine the rate at which a moving clock ticks, you compare readings on that clock to the readings on stationary clocks synchronized in the observer’s frame. And now immediately Einstein points out the following "peculiar consequence", namely, that a clock moved uniformly between two stationary synchronized clocks A and B lags behind B when it arrives there. And then, by extension. This idea can be expressed mathematically by bringing together space and time into a four-dimensional structure, into a space-time manifold- ness.  The proper time interval measured by the moving clock. The corresponding time interval measured in the observer’s reference frame to cmpare They determine the time interval $\Delta t$ between these two events using their synchronized clocks, which rely on Einstein’s simultaneity convention, the sarting point at the same time ... The observer must synchronize their own clocks to establish when the moving clock passes the starting point of the measurement.

% of the motion and accordingly set the clock properly. But the theory of relativity maintains much more; it maintains, namely, that any running mechanism, regardless of kind, would manifest a similar retardation.


%One is not entitled to infer with Lorentz that a unit rod in the aether system will no longer be unity; that  For the relational conception allows us to call that same rod unity in the moving system by definition, and similarly for the units of time on clocks at rest in a moving system. That to change the geometry of space-time ...   That the two arms have the same lenght; this while we measured the lneght of the arm at the same time. Then  \cop{If Lorentz had realized that the length of this rod in the moving system can be legitimately decreed by definition, and similarly for the periods of material clocks, then it would have been clear to him that the ground is cut from under his distinction between "true" ("real") and '10cal" (i.e., spurious or apparent) lengths and times and thereby from his idea that the horizontal arm in the Michelson-Morley experiment is actuaJly shorter than the vertical arm.}.

HOweve, this was just as bad as 

%However, this is not an explation, it is a encode that happens to be.

%Every physical theory tells us what particular behavior of physical entities or systems it regards as "natural" in the absence of the kinds of perturbational influences which it envisions. Concurrently, it specifies the influences or causes which it regards as responsible for any deviations from the assumedly "natural" behavior. But when such deviations are observed and a theory cannot designate the perturbations to which it proposes to attribute them, its assumptions concerning the character of the "natural" or unperturbed behavior become subject to doubt. For the reliability of our conceptions as to what pattern of occurrences is "natural" is no greater than the scope of the evidence on which they rest. And a theory's failure to designate the perturbing causes of the nonfulfllment of its expectations therefore demands the envisionment of the possibility that: first, the "natural" behavior of things is indeed different from what the theory in question has been supposing it to be and that, second, deviations from the assumedly natural behavior transpire without perturbational causes of the kind previously envisioned by the theory.

%(a) the \emph{Einstein contraction}, which results from the relativity of simultaneity and compares the length of the moving rod with the length of the rod at rest in the same Lorentz-Einstein theory; and (b) the \emph{Lorentz contraction}, which compares the length of the same rod lying in the direction of motion in different theories---classical mechanics and the Lorentz-Einstein theory. In the classical theory the coordinate length of the moving rod is expected to be just as the coordinate length of the rod at rest. In the Lorentz-Einstein theory, by contrast, the coordinate length of a moving rod is always shorter than its proper length which is the same in all inertial frames. Nevertheless, Reichenbach claims, the length of a rod in motion can still be said to be shorter than the length that a classical rod would have if both were measured at relative rest in the moving frame.

%There is nothing mysterious in this relation, for it is based on the fact that we do not measure the moving rod, but its projection on a system at rest, is shorter that the rest-length. 

%The dependence of spatial measurements on the definition of simultaneity has a peculiar consequence for processes of propagation such as light and sound waves, that travel from one center in all directions.  This result is the basis of Einstein's principle of the constancy of the velocity of light; the motion of light can be considered as a spherical wave for any uniformly moving system The shape of the surface of the light wave is not uniquely determined but depends on the definition of simultaneity. Distances traveled by light in equal times would then in general not be equal, since according to the Galilcan transformation the velocity of light depends on the direction of the moving system.

%But the very concept of measuring a moving rod while not moving with it requires conceptual innovation.


%More explicitly, the Lorentz-Fitzgerald
%contraction hypothesis asserts a comparison of
%the actual length of the arm, as measured by
%the round-trip time of light, to the greater
%length that the travel-time of light would have
%revealed, if the classical ether theory were true.

%Thus, using light as the standard for effecting
%the comparison, this hypothesis aflirms that in
%the same system and under the same conditions
%of measurement, the metrical properties of the
%arm are different from the ones predicted by
%classical ether theory.

%Unlike the Lorentz-Fitzgerald
%contraction, this “Einstein contraction" is a
%symmetrical relation between the measurements
%made in any two inertial systems and is a
%consequence of the intersystemic relativity of
%simultaneity, because it relates lengths deter-
%mined from diflerent inertial perspectives of
%measurement, instead of contrasting conflicting
%claims concerning the results obtained under the
%same conditions of measurement.

%The philosophical mistake in Lorentz's theory is that he insisted that the moving rod must have the length $\sqrt{ }\left(1-v^2 / c^2\right)$. The assertion that the length of the moving rod is really $\sqrt{ }\left(1-v^2 / c^2\right)$ is the Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction Hypothesis. The significant point is that it differs from

%Now according to classical theory one would expect the coordinate difference of the rod in motion to be one, just as the coordinate difference of the rod at rest is one. 

%1. The Lorentz contraction asserts that the coordinate difference of the rod in motion is less than one by the factor $\sqrt{\left(1-v^2 / c^2\right)$ with respect to the length measured by the classical light-geometry. Indeed, that the time taken is different in this ses Therefore, since both STR and Lorentz accepted the result ofthe Michelson-Morley experiment there is in both theories a Lorentz contraction.

%If we make this decision, then while we will say that the rod has a length of one whether at rest or in motion, never-theless when it is in motion it is shorter than we would expect is to be on the classical theory. However, that rod i moving and have the same lenght.

The assertion that the length of the moving rod is really $\sqrt{ }\left(1-v^2 / c^2\right)$ is the Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction Hypothesis. The significant point is that it differs from. That the correct lenght is that of classical light geometry.

%We now have three elements to Lorentz's theory: there are the two conventions regarding spatial and temporal measurements - a unit rod when placed in motion has the shorter length $\sqrt{ }\left(1-v^2 / c^2\right)$, and the unit indication of the standard clock when placed in motion has the greater length $1 / \sqrt{\left(1-v^2 / c^2\right)}$. With repset to the classical theory, sorted nad with respect;

It is interesting to note here, however, that if we use Lorentz's convention regarding length, then the unit rod when placed in motion has a length $\left.\sqrt{\left(1-v^2\right.}-c_c^2\right)$. Therefore, when the moving rod is then measured in the rest system using Einstein's technique it will be found to have the same length, that is, no Einstein contraction occurs if we use Lorentz's convention regarding length.

%As in his book, Reichenbach uses the following notation. Let's call $l$ a rod that behaves according to the Lorentz-Einstein theory and $L$ a rod that behaves according to the classical theory. Let's label $K$ the rest system and $K'$ the moving system. The rest lengths of $l$ and $L$ in $K$ are equal, or, as Reichenbach put it, $\lK{}{}=\LK{}{}$. In his notation the upper index refers to the system in which the rod is measured and the lower refers to the one in which the rod is at rest. Thus the rest-length of a moving rod from the perspective of a co-moving frame, in other terms its proper length, is $\lK{'}{'}$; the length of a rest-rod from the perspective of the moving frame $\lK{'}{}$ is its coordinate length.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item The \emph{Lorentz contraction} is concerned with the ratio $\lK{'}{'}:\LK{'}{'}$. That is, the Lorentz contraction compares the behavior of the same rod in the Lorentz-Einstein and classical theories in the same inertial system $K'$. 
%
%\item The \emph{Einstein contraction} whereas the Einstein contraction is concerned with the ratio $\lK{}{'}:\lK{}{}$. compares the behavior of two rods in the Lorentz-Einstein theory in different inertial systems, $K$ and $K'$. 
%\end{itemize}


%One may construct a geometry of light* in which light determines the comparison of spatial distances. Thus light comes to serve as the ordering net of physics, which gathers within the meshes of its rays all the events of the world and puts them in a numerical order. With this idea in mind, one mayfurther represent the content of Einstein s theory of space-time in the follow ing way. Clocks and yardsticks, the material instruments for measuring space and time, have only a subordinate function. They adjust themselves to the geometry of light and obey all the laws which light furnishes for the com-

%parison of magnitudes. One is reminded of a magnetic needle adjusting itself to the field of magnetic forces, but not choosing its direction independently. Clocks and yardsticks, too, have no independent magnitude; rather, they adjust themselves to the metric field of space, the structure of which manifests itself most clearly in the rays of light.

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{light axioms} define the equality of spatial and temporal distances for individual frames (\german{Lichtgeometrie} or light-geometry) using light rays alone. In Reichenbach's view the light axioms in \sr do not differ from those in classical theory except for the assertion that the velocity of light is the velocity's upper limit. The relativistic light-geometry claims that light propagates in spherical waves in any uniformly moving system, whereas in the classical light-geometry light propagates in spherical waves only in the ether system. The difference depends on the choice of $\epsilon$, which is in principle arbitrary. 
%
\item The \emph{matter axioms} postulate that material systems used as rods and clocks behave in accordance with the light geometry (\german{K\"orpergeometrie} or matter-geometry). Space distances and time intervals that are light-geometrically equal will also turn out to be equal if measured, respectively, with rigid rods and ideal clocks. Thus the content of \sr can be expressed by saying that rods and clocks behave according to the relativistic light-geometry and not according to the classical one. In other terms, the Lorentz transformation, which leaves the spherical propagation of light invariant, turns out to be the transformation for measuring rods and clocks. If rods transformed according to the Galileian transformations, distances traveled by light in equal times would in general not be equal if measured by rods.
\end{itemize}

%\section{Reichenbach's Axiomatization and The Problem of 
%Explanation}



%Facts that are considered in pre-relativistic theory remain relevant. The axioms contain the fundamental facts whose existence justifies the theory; in principle, they are empirical assertions capable of experimental verification. In addition to these are the definitions through which the theory's conceptual content is constructed. These, in contrast to the axioms, are arbitrary forms of thought, capable of neither empirical confirmation nor refutation. Their arbitrariness is constrained only by certain well-understood logical demands required for a scientifically appropriate system. They must be univocal; moreover, they must lead to a scientific system characterized by certain properties of simplicity. Whether they fulfill these demands is not solely a matter of form but depends upon the validity of the axioms.

%\todo{transport time or absolute velocity}







%Uhren und Maßstäbe, die materiellen Instrumente der Raum-Zeitmessung, haben nur eine untergeordnete Bedeutung; sie fügen sich der Lichtgeometrie ein, sie befolgen also alle Gesetze, die das Licht für den Vergleich von Größen liefert. Man darf etwa an die Magnetnadel denken, die sich auf das Feld der magnetischen Kraftlinien einstellt, nicht aber ihre Richtung selbständig wählt. So haben auch Uhren und Maßstäbe keine selbständige Größe, sondern sie stellen sich auf das metrische Feld des Raumes ein, dessen Struktur am reinsten in den Strahlen des Lichtes zum Ausdruck kommt.

%One can construct a light geometry in which light also determines the comparison of two spatial distances; light thus appears as the actual ordering framework of physics, organizing all events in the world into the meshes of its rays and thereby determining them numerically.

%While in the form of relativity theory originally developed by Einstein, light serves only to establish simultaneity, in Reichenbach's axiomatization light can be used for all time measurements, including the determination of the measure of time, and even for spatial measurements.

%Reichenbach's \scare{constructive axiomatization} consisted of ten axioms, five concerning the behavior of light (\german{Lichtaxiome} or light axioms, \rom{1}-\rom{4}), and five concerning rods and clocks (\german{K\"orperaxiome} or matter axioms, \rom{6}-\rom{10}). 
%

%
%It will be shown that only through these axioms is it possible to construct a complete theory of space and time. Thereby, points at rest with respect to one another are defined without the use of rigid rods; it is a \s{light rigidity} that is defined. Likewise, uniform time is characterized through the motion of light without the use of material mechanisms. The Lorentz transformation can be derived from this. From the light geometric point of view, therefore, it requires no additional axioms at all. The difference between the Galilean and Lorentz transformations is merely arbitrary. Its relationship to rigid rods and clocks is contained in the matter axioms VI-X.



%While the light axioms are already valid in classical optics, the theory of relativity only adds the proposition that the speed of light is an upper bound for signal velocities; in this way the matter axion1s embody a deviation from the classical theory. They contain the assertion that the Lorentz transformation, which differs from the Galilean transformation only in terms of definitions~ ]sin fact the transfor- mation for rods and docks. \q{By separating axioms from definitions, we are able to distinguish between those propositions concerning the motion of light which speak of its physical characteristics and those arbitrary additions, like the concept of si1nuhaneity and we are in a position to be 8ble to univocaBy describe the behavior of materia~ objects without needing any ambiguous auxiliary concepts like \s{shortening} or \s{stretching.}}.

%The light axioms (I-V in A.) can be considered to be well confirmed. Among them, the only new fact is the limiting nature of the speed of light about which surely there is no longer any serious doubt Amongst the matter axioms, VI and VII only contain the long-held assertions about docks and rigid rods that also follow from the classical theory.  We now turn to the matter axioms that have never been exper- imental1y proven. They are as follows:  ...

%\qt{expand upon those consequences which are especially important for physics}{dieienigen Konseqnenzen dieser Untersuchung entwickeln, die gerade fiir die Physik wichtig sind}

%Einstein has shown the way out of this logical circle: we cannot know the simultaneity of distant events at all, but can only define it. Simultaneity is arbitrary; we can lay down whatever definitions we wish concerning it, without giving rise to an error. For if we subsequently make measurements, we will invariably reach the result of the same simultaneity that we inserted by definition in the first place; this process can never lead to a contradiction.


%The first class contains assertions solely about the physical properties of light, without making any reference to material objects. The second class expresses claims about the behavior of rigid rods and natural clocks. According to Reichenbach, it can be shown that a complete "Raum-Zeit-Lehre," can be constructed on the basis of the Lichtaxiome alone, that is, a pure "Lichtgeometrie." On the other hand, as is quite familiar in pre-relativistic physics, the behavior of rigid rods and natural clocks (together with some implicit criterion regarding distant-simultaneity) can also be used to underwrite a "Raum-Zeit-Lehre." The significance of the specific "Materialaxiome" chosen by Reichenbach is that, cumulatively, they entail the identity of the Raum-Zeit-Lehre which they give rise to with that of the "Lichtgeometrie" developed on the basis of the Lichtaxiome. The payoff,

%Reichenbach will later introduce the term of art, “constructive” axiomatizion, for this manner of proceeding (Reichenbach 1924). Its virtue (emphasized in Reichenbach’s subsequent writings, but not in the “Bericht”) is that it permits the separation of the factual content from the conventional components of the theory.



%\subsection{Axiomatizaiton}

%Reichenbach's axiomatization stands apart from the conventional \s{deductive axiomatization} approach in mathematics and physics. In the deductive axiomatization method, a general abstract principle, such as a variational principle, is established as an axiom. In physics, the principle of least action is not directly, but only indirectly, empirically testable through laws. In contrast, Reichenbach proposed a \s{constructive axiomatization,} where empirical assertions, verifiable through experimentation, serve as the axioms. 


%It was one of Einstein's philosophical insights  If we make this decision, then while we will say that the rod has a length of one whether at rest or in motion, nevertheless when it is in motion it is shorter than we would expect is to be on the classical theory.

%But, on this new conception of length, one is not entitled to infer with Lorentz that a unit rod in the ether system will no longer be unity, as a matter of physical fact, once it has been transported to a moving system. For the relational conception allows us to call that same rod unity in the moving system by definition.

Es darf als wichtigstes Resultat dieser Untersuchung aufgefaßt werden, daß diese Trennung möglich ist, daß also auch ohne die Geltung der Materialaxiome, deren empirische Bestätigung noch nicht restlos durchgeführt werden konnte, die Relativitätstheorie eine gültige und vollständige physikalische Theorie ist.

The former are statements solely about the physical properties of light, without any relation to material entities. It will be demonstrated that a complete theory of space and time can be constructed based solely on these axioms. The material axioms state the identity of the "light geometry" thus developed with the space-time theory of rigid measuring rods and clocks. It may be regarded as the most important result of this investigation that such a separation is possible, meaning that even without the validity of the material axioms, whose empirical confirmation has not yet been entirely carried out, the theory of relativity remains a valid and complete physical theory.

%This is essential to understand \qrz{\textins{w}hat is the difference between Einstein's and Lorentz's theories}{Worin besteht nun der Unterschied zwischen der Einsteinschen Theorie und der Lorentzschen?}[229][198]. In order to answer this question Reichenbach distinguishes between the following two statements \rzl{229}{198}:
%
%%[(a)] 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item the length of the moving rod $\lk{}{'}$ measured from the rest frame is different from its proper length $\lk{}{}$. As is well known, the proper length is greater than any coordinate length; the difference disappears only for the co-moving observer.
%
%\item the rest-length of the moving rod $\lk{'}{'}$ is different from the rest-length of another rod $\Lk{'}{'}$ which moves with it but satisfies the classical theory. The relativistic proper length in the moving frame is shorter than the classical length would be as judged from the same frame.
%\end{enumerate}


%As Reichenbach put it, in Minkowski space-time a number $\Delta s$ is coordinated to the coordinate differences $\Delta x_1,\, \dots,\, \Delta x_4$ by means of the fundamental metrical formula $\Delta s^2= \Delta x_1^2+\Delta x_2^2+\Delta x_3^2-\Delta x_4^2$. The minus sign in the rule for computing real distances from coordinate distances is responsible for all the differences between the Minkowski and Euclidean geometry. The lines which are at a constant distance from the origin at $\Delta s$ satisfy the equation $\Delta x^2 = \Delta x_1^2-\Delta x_4^2$ rather than $\Delta x^2 = \Delta x_1^2+\Delta x_4^2$. The contour lines are hyperbolae, and not circles like in Euclidean geometry. The four-hyperbolae in \cref{mr}, like the unit circle in Euclidean geometry, are the set of all points at $\Delta s=1$ distance from $O$. The hyperbola $\Delta x^2 =0$ degenerates into the two asymptotes, which group all other events in space-time into three different classes of intervals characterized by the sign of the quantity $\Delta s^2$. As one might expect, Reichenbach's next step is to find measuring instruments that behave like the indefinite type of metric, just like the behavior of the rods correspond to the definite one. 

%The physical realization of the negative $\Delta s^2$ is a physical object that satisfies the relations of congruence defined by the hyperbolas of quadrants \rom{1} and \rom{2}. The realization of the positive $\Delta s^2$ is a physical object that satisfies the relations of congruence defined by the hyperbolas of quadrants \rom{3} and \rom{4}. The first is called a time-like interval $\Delta s^2 = -1$ and is realized by the proper time of a clock. The rotation of the interval $OQ$ into the position $OQ'$ represents a moving clock. $\Delta s^2 = 1$ is the space-like interval and is realized by the proper length of a rod. The rotation of interval $OS$ into $OS'$ sets the rod into motion. Light rays realize $\Delta s^2 = 0$, the limiting velocity, which cannot be reached but only approached arbitrarily closely. Otherwise rods and clocks behave by following the hyperbolic contour lines.

%As Reichenbach rightly notices, there is a deep disanalogy between clocks and rods. Clocks are intrinsically four-dimensional measuring instruments, since they measure distances between two events. Measuring rods, on the other hand, are three-dimensional measuring instruments; they can be treated as four-dimensional instruments, if events are produced at their endpoints according to the appropriate definition of simultaneity \rzl{217}{187}. It is from this difference that all difficulties arise concerning the behavior of rods.

% \subsection{Lorentz vs. Einstein Contraction in Minkowski Space-Time}



%\qrz{This assertion of the theory of relativity is based mainly on the Michelson experiment}{Diese Behauptung der Relativit\"atstheorie st\"{u}tzt sich vor allem auf den Michelson-Versuch}[226][195]. The Michelson experiment proves that material rods satisfy the light-geometrical definition of congruence in all inertial systems. The matter-geometrical equality of distances happens to coincide with the light-geometrical equality. In other terms, rods set in motion behave according to the hyperbolic contour lines in quadrant \rom{4}. Consider again \cref{mv}. $OM_1$ and $OM_2$ are regarded as equally long if light rays need equal time when they are sent back and forth along $OM_1O$ and $OM_2O$. The negative result of the Michelson-Morley experiment establishes that if $OM_1$ and $OM_2$ are equally long if measured through light signals (in terms of the absence of interference fringes), then small measuring rods that are placed along the arms also mark off an equal number of segments on both arms:
%
%\begin{equation} \label{mic} (OM_1O=OM_2O) \rightarrow (OM_1=OM_2) \end{equation}
%
%According to the classical theory, the implication \eqref{mic} is satisfied only in the ether frame. In all other frames moving through the ether, the rest-length of the rod oriented in the direction of motion will no longer satisfy the implication \eqref{mic}. If $OM_1$ and $OM_2$ are the arms of the Michelson-Morley interferometer, then the fact that the matter-geometrical equality of distances does not coincide with the light-geometrical equality is revealed empirically by the shift in the patterns of light and darkness detected by the apparatus. The Lorentz-Einstein theory claims that the implication \eqref{mic} is satisfied in all frames; the light-geometrical distance always coincides with the matter-geometrical distance in all inertial systems. Light geometry is the same in both cases.
%
%Thus, both Einstein and Lorentz's theories assume that the proper length of the arm of the Michelson apparatus lying in the direction of motion is shorter than it \emph{would be} according to the classical theory. An objection that immediately comes to mind is that it is impossible to compare two magnitudes belonging to different theories, since there is no common standard of comparison. However, according to Reichenbach, his axiomatization provides the common standard: \qrz{In this case, the \latin{tertium comparationis} is light, which in terms of light-geometrical definitions supplies a standard to which the rods of the different theories can be compared}{Das tertium eomparationis ist hier das Licht, welches in der lichtgeometrischen Maßbestimmung ein Maß liefert, an dem die Stabe der verschiedenen Theorien gemessen Werden}[197][228]. The hyperbola in quadrant \rom{4} (\cref{mr}) defines the distance $1$ from $O$. Rods in motion, that is, rotated around $O$, follow the hyperbolas in the Lorentz-Einstein theory, but they do not do so in the classical theory. In this way, in Reichenbach's view, it is possible to compare rods $I$ and $L$, though only one of them has an actual physical existence. 
%
%Thus, the Lorentz contraction is a \emph{real difference}, just as the pressure of gas is really lower according to van der Waals equation than it would be according to the ideal gas equation. This does not mean that Einstein contraction is \scare{apparent}. Reichenbach prefers to speak of a \emph{metrogenic} or (since motion is implied) metrokinematic difference: it depends on the fact that two observers in relative motion measure two different three-dimensional cross-sections of the world-strip of the rod; thus it is a \scare{perspectival difference} \rzl{228--229}{197}. The Michelson experiment implies a real difference between the classical theory and Einstein's theory, as well as between the classical theory and Lorentz's theory. But \emph{there is no difference between Einstein's and Lorentz's theories}: \qrz{The concept of simultaneity does not enter into this problem at all}{In diesem Tatbestand kommt der Gleichzeitigkeitsbegriff \"{u}berhaupt nicht vor}[229][198].
%
%%Thus the difference between Lorentz and Einstein contraction runs as follows: The Lorentz contraction claims that $OS'$ is shorter than $OS'_2$. The Einstein contraction maintains that $OS$ is shorter than $OS'$.



%Thus Einstein's theory, just like Lorentz's, implies a contraction that is independent of the relativity of simultaneity, namely, the Lorentz contraction that implies a comparison of lengths $\lk{'}{'}<\Lk{'}{'}$, i.e., $OS'<OS'^2$ in the same moving frame but in different theories. In addition, however, it contains the Einstein contraction, which compares lengths in the same theory: the proper length and the coordinate length $\lk{}{'} < \lk{}{}$, i.e., $OS < OS_1$. As we have seen, Reichenbach maintained the opinion that the two contractions only happen to amount to the same Lorentz factor as a consequence of the linearity of the Lorentz transformations. The \emph{numerical identity} $OS_1:OS=OS':OS'^2$ is coincidental and it  conceals a deeper \emph{conceptual difference}.

%\footnotep{Recall the barn-pole paradox. There is a barn that is, say, 4/5 of the length of a pole, so that the pole does not fit into the barn if they are placed next to each other while both at rest. A relativistic pole moving at $3/5$ of the speed of light becomes $\sqrt{1-(3/5)^2}=4/5$ shorter than the pole at rest. The hope that it will fit into the barn, however, is misplaced in \sr: what we have compared is the \emph{coordinate length} of the moving pole with the \emph{proper length} of the barn (Einstein contraction). However, Reichenbach seems to claim that \emph{the relativistic pole could be made to fit into the classical barn} if they were both at rest in the moving system (Lorentz contraction)}

%\q{Als grundsätzliche Hypothese der Einsteinsehen Kinematik läßt sich dann der Satz aufstellen, daß die Lichtgeometrie identisch ist mit der Geometrie der starren Maßstäbe und natürlichen Uhren}. Reichenbach was moved by the conviction that complicated structures such as rods and clocks should be introduced at \q{the \lse{end} of a physical theory, not at its beginning}, since a \qt{knowledge of their mechanisms presupposes a knowledge of the physical laws}{so komplexe Gebilde wie starre K\"orper und Uhren vermieden wird; diese Gebilde geh?ren an das \ls{Ende} der physikalischen Theorie, nicht an den Anfang, da die Kenntnis ihres Mechanismus bereits die Kenntnis aller physikalischen Gesetze voraussetzt.}[]\citeptra[365]{Reichenbach1922}[41]{Reichenbach1978}. 


% Not only did Einstein mentions Schlick's work approvingly, but he also declared that Poincaré was \emph{sub specie aeterni} correct in claiming that so that in principle only geometry plus physics could be compared by experience. In reviewing the book version of Einstein's lecture Schlick could interpret this claim as a confirmation of the form of \s{holistic conventionalism} \citep{Schlick1921a} that he had attributed to Poincaré and, then, extended to Helmholtz in his edition of the latter's epistemological writings \citep{Helmholtz1921}. As Reichenbach recognized in his review, one of the merit of the Schlick-edition was to have shown that \qt{Poincaré did not express conventionalism more clearly}{klarer hat auch Poincaré den Konventionaliomus night ausgesprocaen} than Helmholtz already did \citep{Reichenbach1921b}. He hoped to finally meet Schlick in person in Jena at the meeting of the \GDNA, where he was going to present his project for an axiomatization of \sr that he had developed in the previous months (\letter{Reichenbach}{Schlick}{17}{9}{1921}[][SN]). 

% for the following reasons: (1) it does not express, the important Kantian intuition that the non-empirical principles are \s{constitutive} for the concept of the object; (2) it overemphasizes the arbitrary nature of the principles of knowledge, while downplaying the fact that their combination is no longer arbitrary \citep[**]{Reichenbach1922a}.

%From these axioms, he derived the full theory, incorporating additional conceptual elements, such as definitions. These definitions, which Reichenbach termed "coordinative definitions," are arbitrary and lack a truth value. Reichenbach considered Einstein's well-known definition of simultaneity to be a coordinative definition. This definition asserts that when light signals are sent from a source to a mirror at rest and back, the one-way time $\epsilon$ is half of the round-trip time. However, any value $0<\epsilon<1$ could, in principle, be chosen.
